# FastTalkerSkiaSharp
Fast Talker is a native extension of earlier work to establish a free and open source application for use in the treatment of communication disorders.  Fast Tasker is built upon Xamarin Forms and SkiaSharp, both open-source frameworks for use in native development of applications for Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, and Blackberry.  Fast Talker is fully supported on all platforms, though only Android and iOS are actively maintained and under evaluation at this point.

### Features
 - Native views in both iOS and Android
 - Dynamically add picture icons and text
 - Use as home screen, limit access to non-communication apps
 - Includes single item and autoclitic frame support
 - Constructs speech output using native functionality
 - Dynamically resize, mark icons, and apply other within-stimulus prompts
 - Incorporate images from anywhere, including your own camera and local pictures
 - Use boards from other devices, with the supported Open Book Format
 - Setup boards remotely and deliver prompting from another computer or tablet
 - Save all boards automatically, all locally managed!

### Installation
Fast Talker can be installed as either an Android or iOS application.  

### Device Owner Mode (Android)
Fast Talker can be set to be a dedicated, SGD-only device by having the administrator run the following command from ADB:

<i>adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.smallnstats.fasttalkerskiasharp/com.smallnstats.fasttalkerskiasharp.Base.DeviceAdminReceiverClass</i>

Optionally, administators can disable the user warnings displayed on the screen by running the following command from ADB:

<i>adb shell appops set android TOAST_WINDOW deny</i>

Issuing this demand will perform indefinite screen pinning, much as single-use devices (e.g., inventory counters, touch screen cash registers) function.

### Download
All downloads, if/when posted, will be hosted at [Small N Stats](http://www.smallnstats.com). Formal app store/market release planned following formal evaluation through research and clinical development.

### Development
This is currently under active development and evaluation.
