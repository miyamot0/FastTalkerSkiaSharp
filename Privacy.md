# Privacy Policy

Shawn Gilroy built the Fast Talker app as an open source app. This app is provided by Shawn Gilroy and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform website visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use this app.

## Links to Other Sites
This app may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Photography
This app will take pictures, at your choice, of items for use within the app. These are retained on the device and never transmitted, unless you do so by some means other than this app.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
